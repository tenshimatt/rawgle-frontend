# âœ… n8n to Portainer - FIXED!

## The Solution

Your n8n and Portainer were on **different Docker networks**. I've fixed it!

### What I Did:
1. âœ… Connected n8n container to Portainer's `bridge` network
2. âœ… Verified API connectivity from n8n

### âœ… Use This URL in Your n8n Workflow:

```
http://172.17.0.2:9000/api/endpoints/3/docker/containers/json
```

**Why this works:**
- `172.17.0.2` = Portainer's IP on the bridge network (accessible from n8n now)
- Port `9000` = Portainer's internal API port
- `/api/endpoints/3/...` = Your Docker endpoint

### ðŸŽ¯ Update Your Workflow Now:

In the **"Pre-Update Container Status"** node:
1. Change URL to: `http://172.17.0.2:9000/api/endpoints/3/docker/containers/json`
2. Keep the credential: **X-API-Key: ptr_bZy0cA8erGyLH79pGn4s2xp4lStmwjXCgKVps8IiQ7A=**
3. Click **"Execute step"** - Should work now!

Do the same for:
- **"Post-Update Container Status"** node (same URL)

### âœ… Test It:

Click **"Execute step"** in n8n - you should see JSON with all your containers!

## ðŸ“š Why Docker Networking Matters

**Problem:**
- n8n was on `v6_pandora-network` (172.18.x.x)
- Portainer was on `bridge` network (172.17.x.x)
- Containers on different networks can't talk to each other by default

**Solution:**
- Added n8n to the `bridge` network too
- Now n8n can reach Portainer at 172.17.0.2

**Key Lesson:**
Docker networking isn't "basic stuff" going wrong - it's actually working *correctly* with isolation! Containers intentionally can't talk across networks for security. We just needed to bridge them.

## ðŸš€ To Avoid This in Future:

When deploying Docker services that need to communicate:

**Option 1: Same Network (Best)**
```yaml
services:
  portainer:
    networks:
      - shared-network
  n8n:
    networks:
      - shared-network
```

**Option 2: Host Network (Less Secure)**
```yaml
services:
  portainer:
    network_mode: host
```

**Option 3: Connect After (What We Did)**
```bash
docker network connect bridge n8n-container
```

---

You're right that this should have been caught during planning. In a production setup, I'd recommend:

1. **Use a dedicated "automation" network** for all your automation tools
2. **Document network topology** upfront
3. **Test connectivity** before building workflows

But hey - now it works, and you learned Docker networking! ðŸŽ“

**Next: Click "Execute step" in n8n and watch it pull container data!** ðŸš€
