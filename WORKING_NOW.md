## 🐛 KNOWN MINOR ISSUES

### 1. Leaflet Map Icons (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Default markers don't show on `/map` page
**Impact**: Map shows but no pins
**Workaround**: Use `/map-simple` instead
**Fix**: Configure Leaflet icon paths
**Priority**: LOW - map-simple works fine

### 2. Missing PWA Icons (Cosmetic)
**Issue**: 404 on `/icon-192.png` and `/icon-512.png`
**Impact**: None - just browser warnings
**Fix**: Add icon files
**Priority**: VERY LOW

### 3. Viewport Metadata Warning (Cosmetic)
**Issue**: Next.js wants viewport in separate export
**Impact**: None - just build warning
**Fix**: Refactor metadata export
**Priority**: VERY LOW
