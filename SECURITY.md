## Security Measures

### Current Implementations

#### 1. Transport Security
- ‚úÖ HTTPS/TLS encryption for all traffic
- ‚úÖ HSTS header with 2-year max-age
- ‚úÖ Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect

#### 2. Content Security
- ‚úÖ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ‚úÖ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ‚úÖ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ‚úÖ XSS Protection headers

#### 3. API Security
- ‚úÖ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ‚úÖ CORS restricted to same-origin
- ‚úÖ Input validation on all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting (via Cloudflare)

#### 4. Data Security
- ‚úÖ User data isolation
- ‚úÖ Secure session management
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in logs

#### 5. Infrastructure Security
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare DDoS protection
- ‚úÖ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- ‚úÖ Regular security updates
- ‚úÖ Minimal server fingerprinting

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets:**
   - Use environment variables
   - Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
   - Review commits before pushing

2. **Validate all inputs:**
   - Sanitize user input
   - Use type checking
   - Implement schema validation

3. **Follow secure coding practices:**
   - Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
   - Escape output (prevent XSS)
   - Implement proper error handling

4. **Keep dependencies updated:**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

5. **Review security headers:**
   - Test with security scanning tools
   - Monitor CSP violations
   - Adjust policies as needed

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords:**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Use a password manager

2. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):**
   - When available
   - Use authenticator apps

3. **Be cautious with emails:**
   - Verify sender addresses
   - Don't click suspicious links
   - Report phishing attempts

4. **Keep your browser updated:**
   - Use latest versions
   - Enable automatic updates

## Known Security Considerations

### In-Memory Data Storage
Currently using in-memory storage for demo data. This is:
- ‚úÖ Secure for development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not persistent
- üîÑ Will be replaced with database

**Status:** Planned migration to Cloudflare D1

### Authentication System
Using custom header-based authentication:
- ‚úÖ Works for current demo
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Should be replaced with proper auth

**Status:** Migration to Clerk planned

### CORS Configuration
Restricted to same-origin only:
- ‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need adjustment for mobile apps

**Status:** Under review

## Security Tools and Testing

### Recommended Tools

1. **OWASP ZAP** - Web application security scanner
2. **npm audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanner
3. **Snyk** - Continuous security monitoring
4. **Mozilla Observatory** - Security header checker
5. **SSL Labs** - SSL/TLS configuration tester

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Security scan
npm run security-check

# Test security headers
curl -I https://www.rawgle.com

# CSP validation
# Use browser DevTools Console
```

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- **GDPR:** User data protection and privacy
- **CCPA:** California privacy rights
- **Data Retention:** According to privacy policy

### Security Standards
