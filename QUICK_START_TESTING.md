## 🐛 Known Issues to Check

1. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Running `npx tsc` may run out of memory
   - This is normal for large Next.js projects
   - Next.js handles TypeScript compilation during dev/build

2. **Cart State**
   - Cart is user-specific when logged in
   - Falls back to 'demo-user' when logged out
   - Cart persists across page refreshes

3. **OAuth Providers**
   - Google/GitHub sign-in buttons visible but not functional
   - Need OAuth client IDs (future enhancement)
   - Email/password works perfectly
