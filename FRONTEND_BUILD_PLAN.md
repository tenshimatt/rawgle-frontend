# RAWGLE - Frontend Build Plan

**Goal**: Build complete clickable UI with mock data FIRST, connect backend LATER
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for full frontend

---

## üéØ PRIORITY ORDER

Based on your feedback and screenshots:

### Week 1: Core User Journey (TOP PRIORITY)
1. **Navigation** ‚úÖ (Created)

4. **AI Assistant** - Chat interface with mock responses
5. **Pet Management** - Add/view pets

### Week 2: Essential Features
6. **Smart Feeding** - Calculator + logs
7. **Health Dashboard** - Basic tracking
8. **Community** - Forum-style posts
9. **Shop** - Product marketplace

### Week 3: Advanced Features
10. **Education** - Learning hub
11. **PAWS** - Token dashboard
12. **User Settings** - Profile & preferences

---

## üì¶ WHAT I'VE BUILT SO FAR

### ‚úÖ Completed (Last 3 Hours)
1. Navigation component (MainNav) - All links working
2. Mock data structure - Suppliers, pets, feeding logs
3. Complete spec document
4. API integration (ready but not used yet)
5. Build system working

### ‚è≥ Partially Complete
- Supplier search page (has real API, but shows all 9,190)
- Map page (works but needs refinement)
- Home page (basic, needs redesign)

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Choose One)

### Option A: Quick Win - Update Supplier Page (30 mins)
**What**: Modify existing /suppliers page to show only top 5 with better UI
**Result**: You can immediately see the improved UX
**Files to modify**:
- `/src/app/suppliers/page.tsx` - Limit to 5, add map
- Add real-time search like screenshot 1

### Option B: Full Rebuild - New Home Page First (2 hours)
**What**: Create beautiful landing page matching screenshot 5
**Result**: Professional entry point to the app
**Files to create**:
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Complete redesign
- Hero section, features, CTAs

### Option C: AI Assistant Page (1.5 hours)
**What**: Build the chat interface from screenshot 3
**Result**: Cool demo of AI features (mock responses)
**Files to create**:
- `/src/app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`
- `/src/components/ai/chat-interface.tsx`

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

I suggest **Option A** because:
1. You already have a working search page
2. Quick modification to show top 5 (as you requested)
3. You can test it immediately at localhost:3002
4. Validates the "only show closest stores" approach
5. Then we continue building other pages

**After Option A**, we can:
- Get your feedback on the UI
- Decide which page to build next
- Continue iteratively

---

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### My Proposed Workflow:
1. I build one page at a time
2. You test it at localhost:3002
3. Give feedback (good/bad/change X)
4. I refine based on feedback
5. Move to next page
6. Repeat until all pages done

### Communication:
- **Bookstack**: I can create a page for each feature with screenshots
- **Documentation**: Update specs as we build
- **Progress tracking**: Update todos after each page

---

## üé® DESIGN CONSISTENCY

For all pages, I'll use:
- **Colors**: Orange primary (#FF9800), Green accents
- **Fonts**: Current system (Inter + Poppins)
- **Components**: Existing UI library (shadcn/ui)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding/margins
- **Mobile**: Responsive by default

---

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

I'll use:
1. **TodoWrite** - Track current tasks
2. **Git commits** - Version each page
3. **Bookstack** (if you set it up) - Document each feature
4. **Status updates** - After each page completion

---

## ü§î QUESTIONS FOR YOU

Before I continue, please confirm:

1. **Which option do you want first?**
   - A: Update supplier page (30 mins)
   - B: Rebuild home page (2 hours)
   - C: Build AI assistant (1.5 hours)

2. **Mock data or real API?**
   - Use mock data for top 5 suppliers (predictable)
   - Or use real API limited to 5 (variable results)

3. **Deployment preference?**
   - Keep testing on localhost:3002
   - Or deploy each update to Cloudflare Pages

4. **Feedback frequency?**
   - Build entire page then review
   - Or show work-in-progress for feedback

---

## üéØ END GOAL

After 2-3 weeks of building, you'll have:

‚úÖ Complete UI with 11 main pages
‚úÖ All navigation working
‚úÖ All forms functional (with mock data)
‚úÖ Professional look and feel
‚úÖ Mobile responsive
‚úÖ Ready to show stakeholders
‚úÖ Clear validation of UX direction

**Then** we connect the backend:
- Replace mock data with real API calls
- Connect to database
- Add authentication
- Deploy to production

---

## üìù NEXT MESSAGE

Please tell me:
1. Which option (A, B, or C)?
2. Any specific changes to the current supplier page you want?
3. Any pages you want to prioritize?

I'll then build exactly what you need and show you working code within 30-45 minutes.

---

**Bottom line**: I'm ready to start building. Just tell me where to start and I'll create a complete, professional page you can test immediately.
