```

#### Verification Phase
```bash
[ ] Test MCP protocol: echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | docker exec -i mcp-playwright-server node dist/index.js
[ ] Verify 3 tools are listed (run_tests, get_test_artifacts, analyze_failure)
[ ] Check Playwright browsers are installed
[ ] Verify artifact directory is writable
[ ] Test sample test execution
```

### Local Development (Alternative)

```bash
[ ] Install Node.js 18+

```

### GitHub Integration (Optional)
```bash
[ ] Set GITHUB_TOKEN with repo access
[ ] Set GITHUB_OWNER and GITHUB_REPO

[ ] Verify webhook delivery (if using)
```

### Vercel Integration (Optional)
```bash
[ ] Set VERCEL_TOKEN
[ ] Set VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
[ ] Test preview URL access
[ ] Verify deployment detection
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Tests
```bash
[ ] Run test on example.com (or test site)
[ ] Verify screenshot capture works
[ ] Verify video recording works (if enabled)
[ ] Verify trace generation works
[ ] Check console log capture
[ ] Check network log capture

[ ] Check accessibility scanning (if enabled)
```

### Artifact Verification
```bash
[ ] Check test-results directory created
[ ] Verify screenshots are saved
[ ] Verify videos are saved (if enabled)
[ ] Check trace.zip file creation

[ ] Check network.har file
[ ] Review summary.json format
[ ] Check report.html accessibility
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
[ ] Run 3 concurrent tests
[ ] Monitor CPU usage (<80% average)

[ ] Check artifact cleanup runs
[ ] Verify no memory leaks over time
```

### Error Handling Tests
```bash
[ ] Test with invalid URL

```

## Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
```bash
[ ] Check container is running

[ ] Monitor disk space usage
```

### Weekly
```bash
[ ] Review test success rates
[ ] Check artifact storage size
[ ] Verify cleanup is running

[ ] Verify sufficient disk space
[ ] Check memory allocation
```

### Tests Failing
```bash
[ ] Verify target URL is accessible
[ ] Check browser installation
[ ] Review console logs
[ ] Check network connectivity
[ ] Verify timeout settings
[ ] Test with simpler URL first
```

### Artifacts Not Saved
```bash
[ ] Check ARTIFACTS_DIR path
[ ] Verify directory permissions
[ ] Check disk space
[ ] Review artifact settings in .env
[ ] Check container volume mounts
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
[ ] Check resource limits
[ ] Reduce concurrent runs

[ ] Disable trace generation
[ ] Increase timeout values
[ ] Check for memory leaks
```
