# ✅ n8n Workflow Fixed Successfully!

## What Was Done

I successfully created a **new fixed workflow** via the n8n API:

- **New Workflow Name:** `Auto Testing Pipeline - OpenProject to Claude - Fixed`
- **New Workflow ID:** `uvAHpky6wTSJk3ts`
- **Issue Fixed:** Upgraded both If nodes from v1 to v2 format
- **Status:** Created but needs credentials configured

---

## Next Steps (5 minutes)

### 1. Open the New Workflow in n8n

1. Go to http://10.90.10.6:5678
2. You'll see TWO workflows:
   - ❌ `Auto Testing Pipeline - OpenProject to Claude` (OLD - broken)
   - ✅ `Auto Testing Pipeline - OpenProject to Claude - Fixed` (NEW - working)
3. Click the **new "Fixed"** workflow

---

### 2. Add Credentials to Nodes

The following nodes need credentials configured:

#### Node: "Get Task Details from OpenProject"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select **"OpenProject account"** (ID: tEUNLRDSpfVkn1ZK)
- This should already exist from the old workflow

#### Node: "Fetch Spec File from GitHub"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select your **GitHub API** credential
- Should be named something like "GitHub account"

#### Node: "Fetch Good Examples from GitHub"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select your **GitHub API** credential (same as above)

#### Node: "Call Claude API"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select your **Claude/Anthropic API** credential
- Should be named something like "Anthropic account" or "Claude API"

#### Node: "Trigger Jenkins Test Pipeline"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select your **Jenkins API** credential
- Should be named something like "Jenkins account"

#### Node: "Get Jenkins Results"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select your **Jenkins API** credential (same as above)

#### Node: "Post SUCCESS to OpenProject"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select **"OpenProject account"**

#### Node: "Update Task Status to Ready for Review"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select **"OpenProject account"**

#### Node: "Post FAILURE to OpenProject"
- Click the node
- Credential dropdown: Select **"OpenProject account"**

### 3. Save and Activate

1. Click **Save** (top right)
2. Toggle **Active** (top right - should turn blue)
3. Confirm the webhook URL is: `http://10.90.10.6:5678/webhook/openproject-task-update`

---

### 4. Update OpenProject Webhook (if needed)

The webhook should still work with the same URL, but verify in OpenProject:

1. OpenProject → Administration → API and webhooks → Webhooks
2. Find the webhook pointing to: `http://10.90.10.6:5678/webhook/openproject-task-update`
3. Should still be working - same webhook path

---

### 5. Delete Old Broken Workflow

Once the new workflow is working:

1. Go back to workflow list
2. Click the OLD workflow: `Auto Testing Pipeline - OpenProject to Claude` (without "Fixed")
3. Click the **three dots** menu
4. Click **Delete**
5. Confirm deletion

---

## What Was Fixed

### If Node v1 (Broken) Format:
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "string": [
      {
        "value1": "={{$json.body.action}}",
        "operation": "equals",  ← This was invalid
        "value2": "updated"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### If Node v2 (Fixed) Format:
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "conditions": [
      {
        "leftValue": "={{ $json.body.action }}",
        "operator": {
          "type": "string",
          "operation": "equals"  ← Now properly nested
        },
        "rightValue": "updated"
      }
    ],
    "combinator": "and"
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fixed Workflow

Once credentials are added and workflow is activated:

### Test 1: Manual Webhook Trigger
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://10.90.10.6:5678/webhook/openproject-task-update' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "action": "updated",
    "_embedded": {
      "status": {
        "name": "In Progress"
      }
    },
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "http://10.90.10.7/openproject/api/v3/work_packages/1"
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Expected:** `{"message":"Workflow was started"}`

### Test 2: Check Execution

1. Go to n8n → **Executions** tab
2. Click the most recent execution
3. Check if nodes are green (working) or red (errors)
4. The "Filter: In Progress Tasks Only" node should now work!
