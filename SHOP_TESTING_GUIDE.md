- Cart data is stored in-memory Map (will reset on server restart)
- No database persistence yet (Supabase configured but not migrated)

### User Authentication
- Currently uses hardcoded 'demo-user' for cart
- Will be replaced with actual user session when authentication is fully integrated

### Product Images
- Using placeholder SVGs (data URLs)
- Will be replaced with real product images from Supabase Storage

### Checkout
