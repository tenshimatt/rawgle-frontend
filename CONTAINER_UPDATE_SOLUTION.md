# 🐳 Docker Container Auto-Update Solution

## 🎯 Your Question Answered

> "Portainer shows many errors. Old repos that should automatically update. Is this best scheduled using n8n or other? Basically I want the Docker containers maintained and up to date daily."

## ✅ Solution: Watchtower + n8n (Hybrid Approach)

### The Answer: Use BOTH

**Watchtower** = Does the actual updates (reliable, proven)
**n8n** = Orchestrates monitoring and notifications (flexible, powerful)

This is THE best practice for automated container management.

---

## 📊 Why This Combination?

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| **Manual Updates** | Full control | 2+ hrs/month, error-prone | ❌ Don't do this |
| **n8n Only** | Customizable | Complex, more failure points | ⚠️ Overkill |
| **Watchtower Only** | Simple, reliable | Limited monitoring | ⚠️ Missing visibility |
| **Watchtower + n8n** | Best of both | Minimal | ✅ **RECOMMENDED** |

## ⚠️ Critical: Containers to Exclude

**Don't auto-update these without manual review:**

### 1. OpenProject
```yaml
labels:
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false"
```
**Reason:** Database schema migrations can break

### 2. PostgreSQL/MongoDB
```yaml
labels:
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false"
```
**Reason:** Major version upgrades need manual migration

### 3. Any Production Database
**Reason:** Data integrity > convenience

### 4. Containers With Custom Builds
If you modified the image or use custom configurations.

---

## 🎓 Customization Examples

### Weekly Updates (Sunday 2 AM)
```yaml
environment:
  - WATCHTOWER_SCHEDULE=0 0 2 * * 0
```

### Only Update Specific Containers
```yaml
# In watchtower:
- WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true

# In your app:
labels:
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

### Monitor Only (Test Mode)
```yaml
environment:
  - WATCHTOWER_MONITOR_ONLY=true  # Check but don't update
```

### Slack Notifications
```yaml
environment:
  - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL=slack://token@channel
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### Check Watchtower Status
```bash
ssh docker-server
docker ps | grep watchtower
```

### View Update Logs
```bash
docker logs -f watchtower-updater
```

### Manual Update Check
```bash
docker exec watchtower-updater /watchtower --run-once
```

### Check Container Update History
```bash
docker inspect container_name | grep -A 5 Created
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Container Didn't Update?

**1. Check if excluded:**
```bash
docker inspect container | grep watchtower
```

**2. Check if update available:**
```bash
docker pull image:latest
```

**3. Check Watchtower logs:**
```bash
docker logs watchtower-updater | grep container_name
```

### Update Broke Something?

**Rollback:**
```bash
# Stop broken container
docker stop container

# Use backup image
docker tag container:backup container:latest
docker compose up -d
```

**Prevention:** Test on staging first!

---

## 💰 Resource Impact

**Watchtower Container:**
- CPU: <1% idle, ~5% during updates
- RAM: ~20 MB
- Disk: ~50 MB

**During Updates:**
- ~30 seconds downtime per container
- Network: Image download bandwidth
- Disk: Temporary (cleaned after)

**Total Update Window:** 5-15 minutes for full stack
