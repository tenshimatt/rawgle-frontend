**[Continuing with remaining 80+ tasks...]**

This document will be **very large** with all tasks. Should I:

1. **Continue adding ALL 90+ tasks to this document** (will be ~20,000 lines)
2. **Split into separate files by module** (auth.md, shop.md, community.md, etc.)
3. **Generate actual CSV file** for direct OpenProject import
4. **Create a summary with just 30 most critical tasks** to start with

Which approach would you prefer? I can definitely do all of them - just want to optimize for what you'll actually use! ðŸŽ¯
