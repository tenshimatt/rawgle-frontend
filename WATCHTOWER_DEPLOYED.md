---

## ⚠️ Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Docker disk cleanup (1.7 TB freed!)
- [x] Watchtower deployed
- [x] Daily schedule configured (2 AM)
- [x] Auto-cleanup enabled
- [x] Health checks configured
- [x] Monitoring network created

### ⏳ Next Steps (Quick Setup)

#### Step 1: Import n8n Workflow (5 minutes)

```bash
# The workflow file is ready on the server
ssh docker-server
ls ~/watchtower/n8n-workflow.json
```

Then:
1. Open http://10.90.10.6:5678
2. Click "Workflows" → "Import from File"
3. Upload `~/watchtower/n8n-workflow.json`
4. Configure Portainer API credentials:
   - URL: http://10.90.10.6:9000
   - Get API key: Portainer → Account → API tokens
5. Click "Activate"

#### Step 2: Exclude Critical Containers (Optional)

For any containers you DON'T want auto-updated (databases, OpenProject):

```yaml
labels:
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false"
```

**Recommended exclusions:**
- Production databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)
- OpenProject (manual migration review needed)
- Any custom-built containers

---

## 📋 Quick Commands

### Check Watchtower Status
```bash
ssh docker-server docker ps | grep watchtower
```

### View Logs
```bash
ssh docker-server docker logs -f watchtower-updater
```

### Trigger Manual Update Now (Test)
```bash
ssh docker-server docker exec watchtower-updater /watchtower --run-once
```

### Stop Watchtower
```bash
ssh docker-server "cd ~/watchtower && docker compose down"
```

### Restart Watchtower
```bash
ssh docker-server "cd ~/watchtower && docker compose restart"
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Error (Expected)
```
error="server returned response status code 404 Not Found"
```
**This is normal!** The n8n webhook doesn't exist yet.
**Fix:** Import the n8n workflow (see Step 1 above)

### Check Next Scheduled Run
```bash
ssh docker-server docker logs watchtower-updater | grep "Scheduling"
```

Expected output:
```
Scheduling first run: 2025-10-22 02:00:00 -0400 EDT
Note that the first check will be performed in 17 hours, 34 minutes, 50 seconds
```

---

## 📊 What Gets Updated

Watchtower will check these containers for updates:
- All running containers (unless excluded with label)
- Stopped containers (if they have updates)
- Containers using `latest` tag or version tags

**Exclusions:**
- watchtower-updater itself (has exclusion label)
- Any container with `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false` label

## 🎯 Example Update Flow

### Tomorrow at 2:00 AM

```
02:00:00 → Watchtower wakes up
02:00:01 → Scans all containers

02:00:10 → Update nginx
           ├─ Pull nginx:latest (new version)
           ├─ Stop nginx
           ├─ Start new nginx
           └─ Verify health ✓ (30 seconds)

02:00:40 → Update postgres
           ├─ Pull postgres:16
           ├─ Stop postgres
           ├─ Start new postgres

## 🚨 Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Container didn't update
**Solution:** Check if it's excluded or already up-to-date

**Problem:** Update broke something
**Solution:** Rollback to previous image (see docs)

**Problem:** Webhook errors in logs
**Solution:** Import n8n workflow (expected until then)
